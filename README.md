    The point of this script is to take in various health metrics, clean up the data, and 
    produce a meaningful visualization. The scripts are split into three files. The main.py script
    runs all the pieces to complete this project. prep.py is the script used to import data, create
    a dataframe, and cleanup what is needed. Finally, the vis.py file will take the cleaned up 
    dataframe and return a visualization.

    To successfully run this script you will need the strava.csv file to be stored locally with
    the script. You will also need to import pandas and the pyplot library from matplotlib.

    Make any changes to line color, plot size, etc. in the vis.py file. The prep.py file will allow
    you to update columns or change which metrics you want to visualize.
